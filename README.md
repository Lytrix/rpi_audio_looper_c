# Raspberry Pi Audio Looper in C

Welcome to my Raspberry Pi Audio Looper project. A few years ago I wondered what I could do with my many Raspberry Pis. A few years before that I saw someone masterfully work a BOSS Loop Station and create some amazing live music, with just one person! I have often wanted to do that myself.

## Getting Started

I have created instructions on how to setup the Raspberry Pi for audio setup. Rather than duplicate the postings here, I am linking to them in the Instruction Pages section of this page. I broke it out into three sections because they are quite detailed and do take quite a bit of time to get through.

### Prerequisites

For this project you will need:

```
A Raspberry Pi 2 with an SD card installed, running Raspbian 
A USB audio interface, such as Berringer UCA222 which is what I used
A USB to TTL serial port adapter to connect to the Pi via the UART
```
## Instruction Pages

* [Overview](https://rschanrussell.wordpress.com/projects/raspberry-pi-audio-looper/) - The high level discussion and motivation for the project
* [System Setup](https://rschanrussell.wordpress.com/projects/raspberry-pi-audio-looper/getting-ready/) - Setup instructions for required supporting software
* [Audio Looper Setup](https://rschanrussell.wordpress.com/projects/raspberry-pi-audio-looper/setup-of-the-audio-looper/) - Setup instructions for the Audio Looper and a list of commands
* [Audio Looper Design](https://rschanrussell.wordpress.com/projects/raspberry-pi-audio-looper/the-audio-looper-design/) - An explanation of the current design of the Audio Looper


## Acknowledgments

* Special thank you to the Jack Audio guys for making this project simpler, by creating Jack
* Thank you to David Frey for expressing interest and contributing ideas to the design, his interest alone was a strong motivational force
* My family for putting up with my obsessiveness while working on this project
